## Welcome to my AI Development Course  

My name is **Netanel Mazuz** — I’m an educator, an engineer, and someone who's deeply passionate about making advanced knowledge more accessible. I’ve always believed that the best way to learn is to truly *understand* the “why” behind things, and that's exactly how this course is designed.

I hold a degree in **Electrical Engineering** from **Ben-Gurion University**, and I’ve had the opportunity to work at some of the most well-known companies in the field of AI. Today, I teach **robotics**, **physics**, and **software development**, and I constantly look for ways to bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world application.

A few years ago, I completed an **intensive six-month AI development program** at the **Technion – Israel Institute of Technology**, as part of their Division for Continuing Education. That program gave me a solid industry-grade foundation, which I’ve since expanded through hands-on experience, mentorship, and participation in **Kaggle competitions**. Very soon, I’ll also be starting my **second degree**, focused entirely on **Artificial Intelligence**.

### Why I Built This Course

I created this course because I know how hard it can be to find well-structured, deep, and practical learning paths in AI — especially ones that are free.

This material reflects everything I wish I had when I first started my journey in the field. It’s not an entry-level overview, nor is it a series of disconnected tutorials. It’s a **carefully designed roadmap** that brings together core mathematics, practical coding, and real-world AI development — the way it’s actually done in research labs and startups alike.

---

### And Yes — It’s Completely Free

This course is **100% free of charge**. No hidden paywalls. No subscriptions.

This kind of knowledge is often kept behind closed doors — in universities, in industry training programs, or in expensive bootcamps. I believe it shouldn’t be. If you're here, and you’re motivated to learn, then you deserve to have access to this material. So, are you ready?

### What You’ll Learn

You’ll start with the **mathematical foundations** — linear algebra, optimization, estimation, and more — and move into **scientific Python**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning**, including **computer vision** and **natural language processing**. Each topic is broken down into lectures that build on each other, designed to give you both depth and clarity.

Whether you’re a student, a developer, or just someone who’s serious about understanding AI at its core — I’m excited to have you on this journey.

Let’s dive in.  
And if you ever feel stuck, don’t worry. That just means you’re learning something new.
