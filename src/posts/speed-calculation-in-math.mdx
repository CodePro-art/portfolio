## How I Discovered a Hidden Gem of Mathematics

As a teacher of mathematics, physics, robotics, and computer science, I’m always on the lookout for elegant, efficient methods that give students a real edge in problem-solving. I recently stumbled upon one of the most remarkable systems for fast mental calculations—almost by accident.

The story began when a student's parent lent me a book that had helped him perform arithmetic with astonishing speed. Curious, I delved into it and was immediately captivated. It was **The Trachtenberg System of Speed Mathematics**. I couldn’t believe I had never encountered it before. Within hours, I was experimenting with the techniques and marveling at their simplicity and power.

In this article, I’ll briefly introduce the Trachtenberg system and walk you through a few of its core methods.

## What is the Trachtenberg System?

The Trachtenberg system is a mental math method developed by **Jakow Trachtenberg**, a Russian engineer who devised it while imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II. Originally intended to keep his mind active, Trachtenberg’s system evolved into a powerful framework for rapid mental calculation.

Rather than relying on rote memorization or traditional multiplication tables, this method uses **simple, rule-based shortcuts** to perform complex operations with remarkable speed and accuracy—often faster than using a calculator.

## Multiplying by 11

Let’s look at one of the simplest and most impressive techniques: multiplying by 11.

** Example: 321 × 11 **

**1**. **Write the last digit**: 1  
**2**. **Add neighboring digits**:
   - 2 + 1 = 3
   - 3 + 2 = 5
   - (There's no digit before 3, so bring it down) = 3  
   
**3**. **Write the result from right to left**:  
   ➝ **3 5 3 1** → **3,531**

That’s it! No need for column multiplication or scratch paper.

## Multiplying by 12

The rule for multiplying by 12 is: **Double each digit and add the neighbor**.

** Example: 123 × 12 **

**1**. **Start from the right**:
   - Double 3: 6. No neighbor to the right, so add 0 → 6
   - Double 2: 4. Add neighbor (3) → 7
   - Double 1: 2. Add neighbor (2) → 4
**2**. **Write the digits in order**:  
   ➝ **4 7 6** → **1,476**

## Multiplying by 6

The rule for multiplying by 6 is: **Add half of the neighbor and, if the digit is odd, add 5**.

** Example: 497 × 6 **

**1**. **Start from the right**:
   - Digit 7: Half of neighbor (0) = 0. 7 is odd, so add 5 → 7 + 0 + 5 = 12
   - Digit 9: Half of neighbor (7) = 3. 9 is odd, so add 5 → 9 + 3 + 5 = 17
   - Digit 4: Half of neighbor (9) = 4. 4 is even, so no 5 added → 4 + 4 = 8
**2**. **Handle carries**:
   - Rightmost digit: 12 → write 2, carry over 1
   - Next: 17 + 1 (carry) = 18 → write 8, carry over 1
   - Next: 8 + 1 (carry) = 9
**3**. **Write the digits in order**:  
   ➝ **9 8 2** → **2,982**

## Why It Matters

The Trachtenberg system isn’t just a novelty—it offers a different way of thinking about numbers. It trains the brain to recognize patterns, work in steps, and apply logical rules—all essential skills in STEM education.

In a world where we rely increasingly on technology, rediscovering and mastering mental techniques like these is both empowering and intellectually enriching. I now integrate the system into my lessons, and the results have been inspiring: students feel they’ve unlocked a “cheat code” to mathematics.

## Final Thoughts

Mathematics is full of hidden treasures, and the Trachtenberg system is one of them. It reminds us that even under the most difficult circumstances, human ingenuity can shine—and that sometimes, the best discoveries come from the most unexpected conversations.

If you're an educator, I highly recommend exploring this system with your students. And if you're a lifelong learner like me, prepare to be amazed.
